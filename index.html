			<p>In May of 2015, our family made it's first visit to the Big Apple. <br>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.edsullivan.com/ed-sullivan-theater/"; target="_blank">Ed Sullivan Theater</a></li>
						<p>We arrived in NYC on May 21, 2015 ... the day after David Letterman's final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman"; target="_blank";>Late Show</a> aired. <br>
						When we passed the famous theater, they still had the David Letterman signage up, so we caught a piece of history!<br>
						You can even see the famous <a href="http://people.com/tv/david-letterman-snuck-out-of-his-final-show-walked-to-the-afterparty/"; target="_blank">
						Angelo's Pizza</a>, used by Letterman to sneak out onto the streets of Manhattan after his final taping.</p>

						after the American Revolution.  <br>
						Both George Washington and Alexander Hamilton worshiped there.</p>

				<li><a href="http://www.amnh.org/"; target="_blank";>American Museum of Natural History</a></li>
					<p>The American Museum of Natural History is one of the largest museums in the world. It's located across the street from Central Park
						and is made up of 28 interconnected buildings, plus a planetarium and a library. This museum's collections contain over 33 million
						artifacts. <br> Needless to say, we only saw a fraction of them on our short, weekend visit.<br> The animal dioramas and the Dinosaurs
						were what we focused on this trip.</p>

						<p>Our favorite chef to watch on Food Network is <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/profiles/talent/bobby-flay";
						target="_blank";>Bobby Flay</a>, so the first place we targeted for dinner was
						one of his restaurants.<br> Bar Americain was right on our way, walking from our hotel
						in mid-town to the play we were going to see in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_District,_Manhattan"; target="_blank";>
						Theater District</a>.  <br>(We actually planned the timing of our
						trip so we could see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Parsons"; target="_blank";>Jim Parsons</a> (who stars as Sheldon in
						<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/"; target="_blank";>"Big Bang Theory"</a>) <br>in the off-Broadway production,
						<a href="http://www.broadway.com/shows/act-god/"; target="_blank";>"An Act of God"</a>.)<br>
						<span>Neither the restaurant nor the play were a disappointment!</span></p>

						<p>Eataly is the love child of Iron Chef <a href="http://www.mariobatali.com/"; target="_blank";>Mario Batali</a>.<br>
						He created a vibrant marketplace for all things related to Italian food of only the finest quality.<br>  You can shop here, take classes, or sit at one of the
